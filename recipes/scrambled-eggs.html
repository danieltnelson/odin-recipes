    <h2>Descrption</h2>
    <p>Scrambled eggs are so easy to make. Or are they? To the seasoned pro, nothing could be easier. If you've never made them, plan on buying a few dozen, because they gon' burn.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Salt (optional)</li>
        <li>Pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>Cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>Heavy Whipping Cream (optional)</li>
        <li>(You can add basically anything to scrambled eggs, but if you add too much then you're basically making omelets.)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Get your wide flat pan on the stove and crank it to medium heat (usually 5 or 6).</li>
        <li>Crack as many eggs as your heart desires and add them to a bowl. Whip those eggs up with a whippy thingy or even a fork. Whip them until you can no longer tell the egg yolks from the egg whites.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs to your wide flat pan. Get a spatula and start stirring/moving those eggs around. You don't want them to stick to the pan. You may have to ocassionally scrape the bottom of the pan with the spatula to keep the cooked egg from sticking.</li>
        <li>As the eggs cook and as you stir you can add the optional ingredients. Heavy whipping cream will make them a little fluffier.</li>
    </ol>
